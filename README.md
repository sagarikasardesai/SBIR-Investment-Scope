The SBIR program is a highly competitive program that encorages small American companies to engage in federal R&D projects that could lead to commercialisation. The awards allow small companies to explore their technological potential, thereby allowing the US to promote high tech innovation. Additionally, the technologies that these companies work on could play a pivotal role in their respective fields. As a company who invests in small businesses, analysing this data would faciliate better business decisions.

Some questions that can be answered - 
- What is the number of patents filed for an industry?
- How has the SBIR Award amount changed over the years?
- What companies received the most number of awards?
- What was the number of awards awarded by the US agencies and their branches?
- Year wise analysis for the US agencies and their branches 

From the analysis, it can be noted that the number of companies with SBIR awards has gradually decreased.
